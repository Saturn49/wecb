Memory Leak Toolkit

1. Introduction
The unfreed, double freed or overflowed memory cannot easily be found by a programmer with normal manual checking. It will cost too much time of a programmer even such memory leak bug has been found. You can easily detective memory leak problems with the help of Memory Leak Toolkit.

2. Features
1)The Memory Leak Toolkit can report all memory usage status, unfreed memory status and misfreed memory status.  

2)The Memory Leak Toolkit is intently developed for MIPS platform, which can correctly show the full debug information including the full function caller frame stack, function name, file name and line number.

3)The Memory Leak Toolkit will automatically load the new created process’s ELF file and its depended library file such as libcms_core.so... As a result, the Memory Leak Toolkit will monitor all new created process’s memory usage status of target machine after its’ booting on.

4)The Memory Leak Toolkit will allocated memory status  structures for every new created process, so the status of memory usage will not make a conflict between each other

5)The Memory Leak Toolkit adopts Server-Client Model, so the Memory Leak Toolkit’s module that runs on MIPS machine does not allocate any memory at all, so it will do no harm to MIPS machines when running the Memory Leak Toolkit on it.

3. System Design
Memory ref interface implementation
Add the memory usage ref
act_memleak_mem_ref_add();

Del the memory usage ref
act_memleak_mem_ref_del();

Modify the memory usage ref
act_memleak_mem_ref_mod();
Cleanup the memory usage ref
act_memleak_mem_ref_cleanup();


Memory Statics ref interface implementation
Add the memory statics usage ref
act_memleak_mem_statics_ref_add();

Del the memory statics usage ref
act_memleak_mem_statics_ref_del();

Cleanup the memory statics usage ref
act_memleak_mem_statics_ref_cleanup();

Display the entire memory statics usage ref
act_memleak_mem_statics_ref_all_display();

Display one memory statics usage ref
act_memleak_mem_statics_ref_show();

Debug information of Function symbol ref interface implementation
Add the debug information of function symbol ref
act_memleak_func_ref_add();

Find the debug information of function symbol ref
act_memleak_func_ref_find();

Cleanup the debug information of function symbol ref
act_memleak_func_ref_cleanup();

Debug information of File and Line ref structure and interface
Add the Debug information of file and line ref
act_memleak_line_ref_add();

Find the debug information of file and line ref
act_memleak_line_ref_find();

Cleanup the debug information of file and line ref
act_memleak_line_ref_cleanup();

Debug information of Function frame ref structure and interface
Add the debug information of function frame ref
act_memleak_func_frame_ref_add();

Find the debug information of function frame ref
act_memleak_func_frame_ref_find()

Root ref structure and interface
Find the root structure with a pid parameter
act_memleak_ref_root_find();

Cleanup the root structure 
act_memleak_ref_root_cleanup();


Message Queue structure and interface
Send the Message Queue OP including OP_QUIT, OP_DISPAY, OP_ADD, OP_DEL…
act_memleak_send_mq_op();

A thread function handles the Message Queue
act_memleak_recv_mq_thread();

Parse ELF interface
Parse a ELF file to obtain the debug information of it
parse_elf();

For detailed please see the file of Software Design Specification Memory Leak Toolkit R0.2.doc

4. Application in BCM SDK
1)Modify the profile file
Modify the BCM_ROOT/customers/VDSL/TELUS/filesystem/etc/profile
Modify the BCM_ROOT/customers/VDSL/QWEST/filesystem/etc/profile
add "ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up" before smd line.
There is a sample profile in src directory, please read carefully. 

2)Replace the memory.c
Replace ./userspace/public/libs/cms_util/memory.c with src/memory.c

3)modify the SRC and DST of bcm_copy.sh and then sh the bcm_copy.sh
